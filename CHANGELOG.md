## 2.10.0

* Added an option to set the debounce timeout value which applies to all indexes by default, but can be customized for
  each index with a filter:

Dynamic filter name: `algolia_autocomplete_debounce_{$index_name}_{$index_type}`

Where `$index_name` is defined by the Index name prefix set on the WP Search with Algolia settings page and
`$index_type` is the type of index.

Assuming `wp_` is the Index name prefix, the debounce timeout filters would be:

```
algolia_autocomplete_debounce_wp_searchable_posts
algolia_autocomplete_debounce_wp_post
algolia_autocomplete_debounce_wp_page
algolia_autocomplete_debounce_wp_my_custom_post_type
algolia_autocomplete_debounce_wp_users
algolia_autocomplete_debounce_wp_terms_category
algolia_autocomplete_debounce_wp_terms_post_tag
algolia_autocomplete_debounce_wp_terms_my_custom_taxonomy
```

Note that the Algolia Autocomplete settings must be saved after creating one of the above filters.
